# RICK AND MORTY NFT GAME

In this repo you can find a NFT game where you can mint various weapons (NFT) on the Rinkeby network.
You can clone it and run it locally by running `npm start` in its directory or you can go to https://nft-game-mu.vercel.app/.

In this project I learned how to mint NFT through scripts, how they are stored in blockchain, how to work with their metadata in a dynamic way (their state is updated in the network) and how to work with conditional components in React.js, among other things.
